# Hbook

**Hbook** it's a proyect made for a study practice for the *AGBO - KEEPCODING MASTER BOOTCAMP*

**Hbook** is a simple books manager. Gets its book catalog from a JSON from a server, and
storage in local cache, updated at least once per day.

Al the pictures and PDFs are storage in local Cache once needed.

The next step of this proyect is to download on background the files and don't get the
aplication stoped.

This proyect used vf Reader for the PDF display. I don't get any credit for it:
